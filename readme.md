# Backuper
This program can create backup-archives with data which you want. \
When you use it you should give directory path which you want to backup.\
After this Backuper creates directory "Backup" in disk "С"  (You must have system disk "C").\
\
There are 2 files.\
"backup_final.py" is python code.\
"Backuper.exe" is "exe"-file for comfortable using on deviсes without preinstalled python.
